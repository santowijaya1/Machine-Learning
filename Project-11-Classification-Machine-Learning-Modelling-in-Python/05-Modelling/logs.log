If this happens often in your code, it can cause performance problems

The reason for this is probably some large input arguments for a wrapped

THIS IS A JOBLIB ISSUE. If you can, kindly provide the joblib's team with an

If this happens often in your code, it can cause performance problems 
(results will be correct in all cases). 
The reason for this is probably some large input arguments for a wrapped
 function (e.g. large strings).
THIS IS A JOBLIB ISSUE. If you can, kindly provide the joblib's team with an
 example so that they can fix the problem.
